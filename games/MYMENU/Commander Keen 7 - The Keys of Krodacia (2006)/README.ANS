The Keys of Krodacia is the first complete Keen 4 mod, produced by Ceilick with music composed by KeenRush. It is the first episode of the unofficial "The Universe Is Toast" trilogy, and is often referred to as Keen 7. It was released in June 2006, and then re-released in 2009 with new music, additional content and bug fixes.

The story begins immediately where Keen 6 left off. Upon returning to Earth, Billy asks Molly if it would be alright to browse through Mortimer's room, as there could be clues to Mortimer's plans. Persuading her that preventing the destruction of the Universe was more important than her brother's privacy, Billy finds a video tape on Mortimer's desk with a label in Standard Galactic Alphabet. The tape contains a message from Mortimer, giving Billy a clue that the Universal Toaster Cannon is being built on the planet Krodacia.

On Krodacia, Commander Keen finds a gigantic structure with only one entrance at the bottom, locked by seven keys. It's up to Keen to find the seven keys to get into Mortimer's base, and stop the Universal Toaster Cannon!

The story continues in Dead in the Desert, the first complete Keen 6 MOD.
