On a trip with his parents to every kid's favorite place in the universe (Disney World, of course), Cosmo becomes stranded on a planet, his parents vanished.  You direct him as he runs and jumps through different lands, such as alien tropics, haunted forest, ice cave, and future world, to find his parents.  Along the way he encounters the various platform baddies that he must either jump to death in the classic style or destroy with bombs.  Bombs are also useful for finding secrets.  Cosmo is also armed with suction cup arms which he can use to climb up tall walls.
