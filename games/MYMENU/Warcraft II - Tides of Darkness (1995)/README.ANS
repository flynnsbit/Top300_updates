For the kingdoms of Azeroth the real-time battle between Humans and Orcs continues with Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, the sequel to its highly succesful predecessor...

Warcraft II comes with many new features like fighting not only over land but also over sea and air; SVGA 640x480 resolution graphics with many new 3D-rendered buildings and units; multiplayer play support with up to 8 players, as well as a redbook audio soundtrack and a scenario editor that allows you to design and create your own scenarios--however you need to have Windows 3.1, 95 or better to run the scenario editor although Warcraft II is a DOS-based game.
