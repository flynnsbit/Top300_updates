It's all-out war in Scorched Earth, a simple, yet exciting artillery combat game! You and up to nine friends can duke it out on hills and in valleys as you nuke each other into submission in this turn-based tank battle.

At the start of each round, each player purchases their weaponry, and if they choose, shields and parachutes for defense and safety from long drops. Then it's off to battle! Aim your cannon, taking note of trajectory and wind, and fire off your weapons in attempt to take out the opposition. Most of the options are very intuitive, and you can begin playing with only a little bit of information.

The variety of weapons is the real highlight of Scorched Earth. A small sample of these include the standard nukes, which obliterate the screen. There's the Funky Bomb, which scatters smaller bombs in an unpredictable variety of directions. Or, if missiles aren't your thing, you can send your foes a personal gift of flaming napalm. There are also dirt bombs which can be used to bury opponents or yourself, for safety from opposing attacks.

One of the other memorable features are the amusing quips displayed before a shot is fired, and when a tank is destroyed. These can even be added to by editing the files to give your threats a more personal flavor.
