Wasteland takes place in the future after the nuclear holocaust of World War III. You guide a band of Desert Rangers from town to town, gradually uncovering a sinister plot that threatens what's left of mankind.

The game makes use of a skill-based system in conjunction with traditional character attributes to achieve goals and get past obstacles. It is this skill-based system that set Wasteland apart from most other role-playing games created up until then.
