One of Sierra's classic VGA remakes, "Quest for Glory" is a 256-color version of the RPG adventure Hero's Quest with a brand new interface.

It looks like the quiet, fairy-tale-like town of Spielburg could use a hero! The governor's daughter is missing, there is a gang of dangerous robbers who have their camp somewhere near the town, and the witch Baba Yaga is up to some mischief. You, a lonely adventurer, agree to take the job and to help the people of Spielburg.

Although very similar to Sierra's other "quest" games in perspective and interface (as well as in humor), this is not a pure adventure, but rather a RPG/adventure hybrid. The hero can start as either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. Playing as each one of those classes not only gives you different abilities, but also changes many objectives and puzzles in the game, and influences the plot. Walking in the wilderness areas near Spielburg, you will be attacked by enemies and fight them in real- time combat. Instead of experience points and levels system you gain better stats directly after every fight. You can also train your other skills, such as climbing or throwing, by performing the appropriate actions repeatedly.

This remake features VGA graphics (most of the locations and character graphics were completely re-done), and a new, icon-based interface (instead of the text input in the original). You select dialogue choices from a dialogue menu, instead of typing conversation topics by yourself. Combat engine and some dialogues were also re-made.
