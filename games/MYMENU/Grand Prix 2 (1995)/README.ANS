All the circuits and drivers of the 1994 Formula 1 World Championship is recreated in Geoff Crammond's second racing simulation. The game is viewed from within the cockpit - external views are provided primarily for use in replays or demonstrations. Texture mapping and full detail in the rear view mirrors are available for almost every visible feature.

The game has 5 skill levels, 7 driving aids such as automatic brakes and a dotted 'ideal racing line' to follow available on lower skill levels, and variable race and practice session lengths. You will have to alter the car's setup to get the best possible car performance - this ranges from standard features such as brake balance and gear ratios onto more technical ones such as spring settings and the ride height. Multiplayer games involve either taking it in turns on a single computer, or on a linkup.
