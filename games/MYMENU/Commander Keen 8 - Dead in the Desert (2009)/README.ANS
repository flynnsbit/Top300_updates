Dead in the Desert is the first complete Keen 6 mod, produced by Ceilick with music composed by Mr.M and ZidaneA. It is the second episode of the unofficial "The Universe is Toast" trilogy, and is often referred to as Keen 8. It was released on July 21, 2009, and a second version on Sept. 14, 2009.

The Story continues where The Keys of Krodacia left off. After falling right into Mortimer McMire's hands, Commander Keen is transported across the universe to the desert planet Calidune. Landing safely on the planet's surface, Keen meets an alien creature who believes himself to be Commander Keen. After a brief argument over their identities, Commander Keen agrees to help the imposter by searching Calidune for a power source in order to power a fake Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket off the planet. This seems to be the only way Keen can escape the planet and stop Mortimer McMire!
