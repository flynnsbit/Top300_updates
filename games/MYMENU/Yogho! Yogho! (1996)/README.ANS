Yogho! Yogho! is a platform game where the player takes the role of a boy who likes the Dutch yoghurt drink Yogho Yogho. In every level the protagonist has to find one or more objects and bring them to someone or something. Bonus levels full of fruits can be played in between to help the player reach a higher score.
