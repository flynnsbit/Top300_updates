Another update of the hardcore simulation Falcon from Spectrum Holobyte with everything that fans of the game expect, while taking advantage of the latest computer technology. Better missions in this version, as well as being able to fly in an 8-plane force, which you can do while linked to another computer, either by dialup modem or the ever loveable null-modem!
