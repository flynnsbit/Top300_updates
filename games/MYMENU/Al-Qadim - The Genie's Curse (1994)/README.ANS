This is an official Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, 2nd edition computer product. Here's the introductory story the game gives you...

As the youngest son of a Noble Merchant, an easy life lay before you. But the call of adventure beckoned, and so, you left your home for a life of action and danger.

Sea serpents, storms and tattered sails have all proved perilous as the years passed. You've taken ships and defeated fiends, at the side of your instructor, the Master Corsair Sinbar.

But your thoughts always return to Kara, the Caliph's beautiful daughter. It is for her you devote your skill and honors. And it will be her hand in marriage that will be your reward for attaining your goal of becoming a Corsair.

Your adventure begins now, on the hidden isle where Sinbar tests his pupils.

As the game starts, you see your character from the top-isometric viewport, and you must first prove youreself worthy by defeating all the traps placed in the testing maze. Then you will come home, awaited by your sister, and town guards, and you're ready to role your dice and step into the unknown.
