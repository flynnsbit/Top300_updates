This is the first game in a popular Rally Championship series. Network Q RAC Rally, as well as other titles, gives you an opportunity to participate in a long-running British rally championship.

To do so, you can choose one of the five cars: Toyota Celica, Ford Escort, Lancia HF Integrale, Mitsubishi Evolution and Subaru Impreza. The only customizable thing here is the tire type.

Controlling your vehicle is rather easy and driving model isn't complex, however, you can damage your machine and end your race before reaching the finish line.
