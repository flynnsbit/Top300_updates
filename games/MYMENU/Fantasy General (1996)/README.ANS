Fantasy General is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world with some steampunk/high-tech elements.

The forces of evil, in the form of the dreaded Shadowlord and his henchmen, have conquered most of the world. On the brink of defeat, the player (in the form of one of four heroes) is summoned as champion who will change course, free the world and defeat evil - or lose all.

The game features 10 unit types from four realms with lots of upgrades, complemented by a similar plethora available primarily to the opponent. Most of the game takes place on battle maps. Outside of those there's just a bit of basic recruiting, setting research priorities and financial managing. Battle maps are hex-based and feature lots of different terrain types that require a suitable approach - cavalry will rule on plains but is crippled in swamps. The player should build an army that is composed of the right mix of units and can adapt to new situations.

The game will look similar to players familiar with Panzer General since it uses a modified engine of said game.

The game offers two modes: the campaign against the Shadowlord or arena mode (single battle) against a computer or human opponent.

In campaign mode, the player selects one of four heroes, each with his or her special abilities and sets out to defeat the Shadowlord. The player must prove his or her own ability to adapt play style and army across five continents with different challenges until the player finally defeats the Shadowlord on Fire Isle.
