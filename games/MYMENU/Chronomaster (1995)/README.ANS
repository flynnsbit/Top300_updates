Chronomaster is an adventure game, written by two famous science fiction authors, Roger Zelazny and Jane Lindskold.

It takes place in a future where universe creation has been taken to an art form with the advent of Pocket Universes (a concept introduced in this game by Zelazny). In the game you play the role of Rene Korda, one of the most respected creators of Pocket Universes in the galaxy. The Terrn Regional Government asks you to intervene when five Pocket Universes are put to stasis by an unknown force.
