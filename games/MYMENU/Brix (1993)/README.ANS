Brix is a near exact clone of the Taito game Puzznic. You are presented with an array of pieces, which you can move horizontally, and when two or more of the same type touch, they disappear. The goal is to do that to every brick of the same geometrical shape painted on it, and fast, 'cuz time is running out quickly. When you have an odd number of a particular piece, 3 of them must be removed by ensuring that they make simultaneous contact.
