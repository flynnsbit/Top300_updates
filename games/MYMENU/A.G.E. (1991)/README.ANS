Sequel to Galactic Empire.

A.G.E. (= Advanced Galactic Empire) is an early first-person space/adventure hybrid from Coktel Vision. Both games sports a fast 3D engine. As you pilot your spacecraft around the planets and stars, engaging in space combat and conversation with other characters, you unravel the Conquer the Universe plot.

The game is similar to Elite in that you are relatively free to travel to wherever you please.
