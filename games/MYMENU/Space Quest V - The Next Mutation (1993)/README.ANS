After travelling back and forth through time on Space Quest 4, Roger Wilco is back in the Starfleet Acadamy, serving as both a cadet and a janitor (so what else is new?). Cheating his way through the Starfleet Aptitude Test, Roger is finally given the rank of captain, his own ship (a garbage scow) and a mission: to explore strange new worlds (which no man in his right mind would explore), to seek out new life and new civilizations (that grew out of the massive amounts of trash Roger will collect on his way), to boldly go where no man has gone before (fortunately for him)!
Step by step Roger will have to unveil a galaxy-wide biohazardous material dumping scheme, solve the mystery of the disappearance of a fellow Starfleet captain and his ship, and confront an agent of an old nemesis.

Space Quest V: The Next Mutation is an adventure games in Sierra's Space Quest series, and just like its brethren, it's characterized by lots of humor (and lots of opportunities to die horribly). SQV is entirely mouse-controlled: you interact with the world by clicking on locations, people and objects on the screen, and you can cycle between various actions (Walk to, Look at, Interact with, Talk to, Give Order to - your garbage scow has a crew over which you preside!) by clicking the right mouse button or by using the icon bar. The icon bar also contains icons that allow you to access your inventory, quit the game or change the settings.
